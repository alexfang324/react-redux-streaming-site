## About this Project

This is a live-streaming website built using React, Redux and node.js. User authentication is handled by OAuth2 authentication using Google API and live-streaming is achieved through a basic rtmp server that user can connect to using OBS studio. The streaming details are stored in json formats in a json-server database available in node.js
